1.5 Speed Calculation


Scenario: A travel app calculates average speed using distance and time.

Algorithm:

1. Initialize the variables distance, time.

2. Calculate speed: speed = distance / time

3. Print the average speed.

Code:
distance = 300
time = 5
speed = distance / time
print("Average Speed:", speed, "Km/h")

Output:
Average Speed: 60.0 Km/h
