1.2 Simple Interest Calculation

Scenario: A bank application calculates simple interest for a customer.

Algorithm:

1. Initiate the variable principal, rate, time.
 
2. Calculate the interest: interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100
   
3. Print the simple interest.
 
Code:
P = 1000
M = 5
t = 3
interest = (P * M * t) / 100
print("Simple Interest:", interest)

Output:
Simple Interest: 1500.0
